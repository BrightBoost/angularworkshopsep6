There are online tools available that allow users to write, share, and test Angular code without having to set up a local development environment. One of the most popular tools is StackBlitz. 

**StackBlitz** is an online IDE where you can create live projects â€” it's especially good for Angular and React projects. Here's how you can use StackBlitz for your exercises:

1. **Visit StackBlitz:**
   - Go to [StackBlitz](https://stackblitz.com/).
   - Click on the "Start a New Workspace" and choose Angular to create a new project.

2. **Following the Exercise Steps:**
   - Once the project loads, you'll see a file explorer on the left, a code editor in the center, and a live preview to the right.
   - You can follow the exercise steps provided here in this environment.
   - To create components, you can right-click on the `app` folder and select 'Generate Component'. This simulates the Angular CLI's generate component command.
